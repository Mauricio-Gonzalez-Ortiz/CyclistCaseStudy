# CyclistCaseStudy
Case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional CertificateÂ¶
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing program in Chicago,
which has since grown to include 5,824 geotagged bikes and 692 stations citywide. 
The bikes can be unlocked at one station and returned to any other station within the system at any time.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on building brand recognition and appealing to broad consumer segments. 
They offer flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, all-day passes, and annual memberships. 
Customers who buy single-ride or all-day passes are known as occasional cyclists, while those with annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Financial analysis revealed that annual members are more profitable than occasional cyclists.
To continue their growth, Cyclistic aims to maximize annual memberships. 
Instead of targeting all new customers, Moreno, the marketing director, believes they can convert occasional cyclists into annual members, 
as these cyclists are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen the service for their mobility needs.

Moreno's goal is to design marketing strategies focused on converting casual cyclists into annual members. 
To achieve this, the marketing analyst team will analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand 
the differences between annual members and casual riders, the reasons why casual riders might opt for a membership, 
and how digital media could impact their marketing tactics.
